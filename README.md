# JavaScript: Password Generator

The password can include special characters. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

```

## Summary

This website allows to generate random password based on certain criteria. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is presented with a prompt asking for the length of the password. The accepted password should be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. If the users enters a text and not a number, an alert appears to the user and the pompt exits. The user is asked to confirm whether or not to include certain character types in the password. Character types can be lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. At least one character type should be selected. Then the password is generated based on the selected criteria and it appears in the text area.
